    "Regression?\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks, predicting discrete (often binary) outcomes by estimating the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values using a linear combination of input features, logistic regression applies a non-linear transformation to constrain output between 0 and 1, representing probabilities. Linear regression uses least squares to minimize errors, while logistic regression employs maximum likelihood estimation, modeling log-odds rather than numeric values."

    "2. Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.\n",
    "    - The sigmoid function, also called the logistic function, transforms the linear model output into a probability bounded between 0 and 1. Its S-shaped curve ensures that predicted values map naturally to probabilities suitable for binary classification."

    "3. What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?\n",
    "    - Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the logistic regression model, typically using L1 (lasso) or L2 (ridge) penalties. Regularization is essential, especially with many features or small datasets, since it encourages simpler models that generalize better by discouraging reliance on individual variables, enhancing predictive performance."

    "    - To build a Logistic Regression model for predicting campaign response, I would first clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, I’d address this using class weights (class_weight=\"balanced\") or resampling methods like SMOTE. Then, I’d train the model with feature scaling applied and tune hyperparameters (C, penalty, solver) using GridSearchCV with stratified cross-validation. For evaluation, I’d avoid plain accuracy and instead rely on precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, along with business metrics like lift and gain charts to measure real campaign impact. Finally, I’d deploy the model to assign probabilities to customers and target the top-ranked group for the marketing campaign."
